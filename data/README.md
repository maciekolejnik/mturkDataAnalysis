This directory contains data collected in the 
experiment in JSON format.

The most important file is ```firstStudyBackup.json``` - it 
stores the most relevant data, including all the interaction 
of participants with our game. ```pilotStudyBackup.json``` is a 
file of similar format (with less fields) but with much less data.
The other two files record auxiliary data to do with MTurk
(```BackupAssign```) and evaluations of predictions 
(```BackupEvals```) - that is unlikely to be useful to others.

Please consult the DPhil thesis to make sense of the data.
